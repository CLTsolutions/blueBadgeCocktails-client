## About The Bar Cart
This app was inspired by our desire to allow anyone to become their own bartender during the 2020-21 Coronavirus Pandemic. Users can register on the app to find cocktail recipes by using the search functionality which calls on an external [API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/). Users can then favorite cocktails they're interested in, add them into their library (MyBar) and also create and update their own drinks.

This app demonstrates full CRUD functionality using the PERN stack.
